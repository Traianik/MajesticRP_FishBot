# Majestic GTA V RP Fish Bot with Simple GUI (Discontinued)

This Fish Bot is designed for the Majestic GTA V RP Server and comes with a user-friendly GUI. I created this bot for fun and decided to share it with everyone who may find it useful. The bot continuously fishes in-game, so be sure to monitor your backpack's capacity. Additionally, if the bot doesn't detect any fish for 80 seconds, it will stop working automatically.

## How to Run

To get started, follow these steps: 

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.10.7 or a higher version installed.

2. **Install Requirements**: Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the script**: Execute the main script by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py

## Important Notes

- **Use at Your Own Risk**: It's important to be aware that using this bot while AFK can result in a ban on the Majestic GTA V RP Server, so use with caution.

- **Customized Fish Screenshots**: Each in-game location requires its own screenshot of fish for the bot to work effectively, the default location is the first fishing location.

- **Resolution Requirement**: This bot has been tested and confirmed to work properly only at a resolution of 1920x1080.
